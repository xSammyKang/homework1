What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

In the case of a merge, we are adding a point at the end of our branch's history where the commit histories of
it and a separate branch are joining together (through a merge commit). This is simple and does not require tampering
with the branch history.

However for a rebase, we are moving the point that represents when our branch initially diverged from its parent branch 
to the very end of the parent's history. In this way, instead of the commit history of the parent branch showing that our 
separate branch broke off somewhere in the past, it appears as if it only just diverged from it. This can lead to a more
neat branch history (linear instead of paths with multiple parents), but you can lose context (such as when previous changes
were made to the branch).
